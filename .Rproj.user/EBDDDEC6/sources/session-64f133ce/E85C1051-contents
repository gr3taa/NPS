# Bike-Sharing
Every day, thousands of people use the bikes to get around, some commuting to work, others taking a leisurely ride on sunny days. However, behind this constant flow of rentals, there is a major challenge: ensuring the bikes are always in perfect condition.

One day, the head of Data Science at Capital Bikeshare, a major bike-sharing service in Washington D.C., poses an important question:

> "How can we optimize bike maintenance by leveraging weather conditions and peak usage times?"

To address this, we analyze rental data to identify patterns in demand across different days and weather conditions. By understanding when and how bikes are used most, we aim to develop a data-driven approach to scheduling maintenance efficiently, ensuring availability while reducing the impact on service.

Regular maintenance not only extends the lifespan of the bicycles but also guarantees the safety and satisfaction of the users.

### Maintenance Tasks
The maintenance tasks are routine checks and minor repairs that can be performed quickly on-site. Examples include:

- **Tire inflation** and replacement of inner tubes  
- **Brake adjustments** to ensure proper stopping power  
- **Lubrication of the chain** to prevent rust and ensure smooth operation  
- **Gear tuning** for optimal shifting performance  
- **Replacing lights or reflectors** for safety compliance  

### Optimized Maintenance Schedule
To avoid a shortage of bikes during peak rental hours, we propose an optimized maintenance schedule based on the following principles:  

- **Type of the day** (weekday vs. weekend patterns)  
- **Peak hours** (morning/evening rush hours, lunchtime usage)  
- **Weather conditions** (rain, temperature, and seasonal variations)
